Server Side Application
This project involves building the server side of our application. It includes handling client requests, connecting to a database, processing queries, implementing forms on the client side, and processing input from the client side to the server side.  
Project Structure
The project is organized in a structured folder hierarchy. The structure includes separate folders for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python files.  
Client Routing Requests
The application includes functions to handle each request that comes from a client. These functions are designed according to the principles taught in class.  
Database Connection and Queries
The application connects to a database and processes SQL queries. Detailed instructions for connecting to the database will be provided later.  
Forms Implementation
The forms on the site are designed so that their action attribute points to the page/path to the file that will handle the form data (user input). The data from each form is processed according to the purpose of the form, which may involve selecting, adding, updating, or deleting information from the database.  
HTML to Templates
The HTML pages of the application have been converted into templates as taught in class.
